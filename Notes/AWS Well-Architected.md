# The 6 Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected  
1. Security   
- focuses on protecting data, systems & assets  
- confidentiality of data  
- identity & access management  
-controls to deduct security threats  
   
2. Cost optimization  
-avoiding unnecessary costs  
-using right type of resources  
-making cost effective decisions  
   
3. Performance efficiency  
-using computing resources efficiently  
-maintaining the efficiency as changes occur  
   
4. Sustainability  
-minimizing environmental impact of running cloud workloads  
   
5. Operational excellence  
-running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continuity  
-perform operations as code  
-make frequent, small, reversible changes  
-refine operations procedures frequently (constant improvement)  
-anticipate failure (identify possible failures before they occur)  
-learn from operational failure  
   
6.Reliability  
-ability of a system to recover from disruptions, dynamically meet demand & mitigate disruptions  
-automatically recover from failure  
-test recovery procedures  
-horizondal scale to increase aggregate workload availability  
-stop guessing capacity  
-manage change through automation

# 6 Application Migration Strategies:  “The 6 R’s”
1. Refactoring / Re-architecting  
Re-architecting with cloud native features  
on prem to cloud services  
 
2. Replatforming   
Lift, reshape/tinker & Shift  
traditional server to cloud(EKS)  
 
3. Rehosting  
Lifing & shifting application  
traditional server to cloud (EC2)  
 
4. Repurchasing  
Moving to a different product.  
BI Tools  
Reporting Tools(Zoho Analytics)  
(Simple email service, Connect)  
 
5. Retain   
No changes as of now. Re-Visit  
 
6. Retire   
Get rid of.
